        <h3>Junior Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>I recently completed the Le Wagon 9 week Full-Stack Bootcamp in Lisbon. I joined it after dropping out of college, where I was taking a Law degree. I started to realize that Law wasn't what I wanted for my future and decided to change my career path.</p>
        <p>Searching for a new career path I stumbled across web development.
</p>
        <p>In Le Wagon, I learned HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, git, GitHub, and Heroku. I also learned and improved soft skills like my workflow, teamwork, dealing with deadlines, and problem-solving.
</p>
        <p><strong>Now I'm searching for a job where I can grow. By learning new programming languages and improving the ones that I already know. And continue to improve my soft skills.
